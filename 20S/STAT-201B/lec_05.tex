\textbf{Done}: 5.1 and 5.2

\textbf{Today}: More on 5.2

Skip 5.4 [Done in 205A], start 5.5.

\subsection{Remaining issues of 5.2}

Fix countable state space $S$, transition matrix $P$ on $S$ a $S \times $ matrix
row stochastic. Recall definition of transient / recurrent states:
\begin{align*}
  \text{$x$ is recurrent } &\iff \Pr_x[N_x = \infty] = 1 \\
  \text{$x$ is transient} &\iff \Pr_x[N_x < \infty] = 1
\end{align*}
where $N_x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \ind\{X_n = x\}$.
No other option is possible.

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 5.3.2]
  If $x$ is recurrent and $\rho_{xy} > 0$, then $Y$
  is recurrent and $\rho_{yx} = 1$ (and $\rho_{xy} = 1$).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \incfig[0.75]{revisiting-recurrent-state}
    \caption{Revisiting recurrent state, the chain goes on excursions
      between visits to $x$. We can regard the whole chain $(X_i)$ with $X_0 = x$
      as a succession of $x$-blocks
    }
    \label{fig:revisiting-recurrent-state}
  \end{figure}

  $0 < \rho_{xy} \implies \Pr_X[\text{hit $y$ before $T_x$}] > 0$

  By the strong Markov property, the $x$-blocks
  are IID copies of the first $x$-block.
  So suppose $\Pr_x[\text{hit $y$ before $T_x$}] = 0$.
  Then $\Pr[\text{$x$ block contains a $y$}] = 0$,
  so $\Pr[\text{any of first 19 $x$ blocks contain a $y$}] = 0$,
  so $\Pr[\text{some $y$ before $T_x$ hit}] = 0$.
\end{proof}

Can we do it without contradiction? Write
\[
  \rho_{xy} = \sum_{n \geq 1} \Pr_x[T_y = n]
\]
Notice
\[
  \Pr_x[T_y = n] = \sum_{x = (x_i)_{i=1}^n, x_n = y, x_i \neq y~\forall i < n}
  \underbrace{\prod_{i=1}^n P(x_{i-1}, x_i)}_{\Pr[\text{path}]}
\]
whereas
\[
  \Pr_x[T_y < T_x] = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{x = (x_i)_{i=1}^n, x_n = y, x_i \neq x~\forall i < n} \Pr[\text{path}]
\]
\textbf{Claim}: each of the two above sums is $> 0$ iff the other is.
Suppose the first sum $> 0$.
Then exists $n$ and some path $(x_i)_1^n$ with all $x_i \neq y$.
So $\Pr[(x_i)_1^n] > 0$.

In general, most things involving Markov chains are just questions about
sums over paths. The hard part is identifying which paths we are talking about.

\textbf{Formalities}: What is an $x$-block? An $x$-block is an element of
$\cup_{n \geq 1} S^n$ such that $x_0 = x$, $x \not \in x_{1:n}$

\subsection{Key classes of SPs defined by symmetries}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Independent, IID
  \item $(X_i)_{i}$ is \emph{exchangeable} $\iff (X_{\pi(i)})^n_i \deq (X_i)^n_i$.
    for all $n$ and $\pi \in S_n$ a permutation of $[n]$.
  \item $(X_i)$ is \emph{reversible}
    $\iff (X_n, X_{n-1}, \ldots, X_1) \deq (X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ for all $n$. Obviously exchangeable $\implies$ reversible, but reversible is much weaker.
  \item $(X_1, X_2, \ldots)$ is \emph{stationary},

    $\iff (X_2, \ldots, X_{n_1}) \deq (X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ for all $n$ on $S^n$,

    (by $\pi$-$\lambda$) $\iff (X_2, X_3, \ldots) \deq (X_1, X_2, \ldots)$ on $S^\infty$
\end{enumerate}
