\begin{proposition}[Simple Markov property]
  For any fixed time $n$
  \[
    (X_n, X_{n+1}, \ldots \mid X_n = x) \deq (X_0, X_1, \ldots \mid X_0 = x)
  \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  To show $X \deq Y$, show $\Pr(X \in A) = \Pr(Y \in A)$
  for all $A$ in a $\pi$-system. Here $\pi$-system
  is FDDs, so (by Kolmogorov) its enough to take
  \[
    A = (X_0 = x_0, X_1 = x_1, \ldots, X_m = x_m)
  \]
  for any choice of $x_0, \ldots, x_m$.
  We need
  \begin{align*}
    \Pr[X_n = x_0, X_{n+1} = x_1, \ldots, X_{n+m} = x_m \mid X_n = x]
    &= \Pr[X_0 = x_0, X_1 = x_1, \ldots, X_m = x_m \mid X_0 = x]
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

Recall $\cF_T$ where $T$ is a stopping time:
\[
  A \in \cF_T \iff A \cap \{T \leq n \} \in \cF_n
\]
\begin{proof}
  Key fact: $\{T=n\} \in \cF_n$.
  Given $\{T = n \}$ and the $\cF_T$ info, you basically know some
  $\cF_n$ fact.
\end{proof}
