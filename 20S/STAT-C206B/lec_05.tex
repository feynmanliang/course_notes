\lecture{5}{2020-02-04}{Extreme point representation of measures}

Throughout, let $E$ be a real TVS.

\begin{definition}
  For convex $A \subset E$, an \emph{open segment} is
  a subset of type
  \[
    \{(1-\lambda) a + \lambda b : \lambda \in (0,1) \},\qquad a\neq b \in A
  \]
  $x_0 \in A$ is an \emph{extreme point} of $A$ if it belongs to no open segment
  of $A$, i.e.
  \begin{align*}
    &(\exists \lambda \in [0,1] : x_0 = (1-\lambda) a + \lambda b) \\
    &\implies x_0 = a \text{ or } x_0 = b
  \end{align*}
  Closed $B \subset A$ is an \emph{extreme subset} of $A$ if
  \begin{align*}
    &(\exists \lambda \in (0,1) : (1-\lambda) a + \lambda b) \in B) \\
    &\implies \{a,b\} \subset B
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:cvx-subset-has-extreme-subset}
  Let $E$ real Hausdorff TVS, $A \subset E$ nonempty compact convex,
  $f$ continuous linear functional on $E$, $\beta = \inf_{x \in A} f(x)$.
  Then $B = A \cap f^{-1}(\beta)$ is nonempty, compact, extreme subset of $A$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  $\beta$ exists because $A$ is compact.

  Continuity and linearity of $f$ ensure $B$ is closed and convex.
  Check nonempty and compact.

  To show $B$ extreme, suppose $(1-\lambda)a + \lambda b \in B$
  for $a,b \in A$ and $\lambda \in (0,1)$.
  If, for example, $a \not\in B$, then $f(a) > \beta$ by definition
  of $B$ and so by linearity
  \[
    f((1-\lambda) a + \lambda b)
    = (1 - \lambda) f(a) + \lambda f(b) > (1 - \lambda) \beta + \lambda \beta
    = \beta
  \]
  contradicting $(1-\lambda)a + \lambda b \in B$

\begin{theorem}
  $E$ real Hausdorff LCTVS, $A$ nonempty compact convex subset of $E$, then
  $A$ is the closed convex hull in $E$ of the set of extreme points of $A$.
\end{theorem}

This is saying something along the same lines as Caratheodory's theorem
for convex things.

\begin{proof}
  We first show each nonempty extreme subset $X \subset A$ contains an extreme
  point of $A$. Let $\fX$ consist of extreme subsets of $A$ contained in $X$.
  $\fX$ is nonempty (by \cref{lem:cvx-subset-has-extreme-subset}),
  so partially order $\fX$ by inclusion.
  Notice the intersection of any chain is a non-empty compact set $\in \fX$
  because it is
  the intersection of nonempty compact sets (c.f. Hausdorff's theorem), hence
  by Zorn's lemma $\fX$ possesses a minimal element, say $Y$.

  It remains to show $Y$ is a singleton. Otherwise, $Y$ would contain $x \neq y$
  and since $E$ is Hausdorff and LC, (by Hahn-Banach separating hyperplane version)
  there exists continuous linear function $f$ on $E$ such that $f(x) < f(y)$.
  By \cref{lem:cvx-subset-has-extreme-subset}, $Z = Y \cap f^{-1}(\inf f(Y))$
  is a nonempty extreme subset of $A$ that does not contain $y$.
  Thus $Z \subsetneq Y$, contradicting minimality of $Y$.

  In the second step, let $B$ be the closed convex hull in $E$ of the set of all extreme points of $A$.
  $B$ is compact, convex, and contained in $A$.
  To show $B = A$, it suffices to show $A \subset B$ is empty.
  Suppose towards contradiction $x_0 \in A \setminus B$, then by Hahn-Banach
  theorem there exists (separating) continuous linear functional
  $f$ on $E$ such that $\inf_B f(x) > f(x_0)$.
  Then by \cref{lem:cvx-subset-has-extreme-subset} $W = A \cap f^{-1}(\inf_A f(x))$
  is a nonemmpty extreme subset of $A$ disjoint from $B$.
  However, by the previous part $W$ would contain an exterme point of $A$,
  which is a contradiction since $W \cap B = \emptyset$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  Suppose $E$ is Hausdorff real LCTVS, $K \subset E$ compact whose closed
  convex hull $A$ is compact. THen each extreme point of $A$ belongs to $K$
\end{proposition}

    \incfig{higher-dim-extreme-pt}
    \caption{higher-dim-extreme-pt}
    \label{fig:higher-dim-extreme-pt}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
  Let $x \in A$ be extreme point. For any closed convex nbd $0 \in U \subset E$,
  by compactness of $K$
  there exists fintely many $a_i \in K$ such that $a_i + U$ cover $K$.
  Let $A_i = \overline{\conv(K \cap (a_i + U))}$, each $A_i$ is compact
  because $A_i \subset K$ and $K$ is compact. 
  Then $\conv(\cup_i^n A_i)$ is compact and
  $K \subset \conv(\cup_i^n A_i) \subset A$, so we must have
  $A = \conv(\cup_i^n A_i)$.

  Hence, $x = \sum_i^n \lambda_i x_i$ with $x_i \in A_i$, $\lambda_i \geq 0$,
  $\sum_i \lambda_i = 1$. As $x \in A$ is extreme point, $x$ must
  coincide with some $x_i$. Thus, $x \in A_i \subset a_i + U$,
  so $x \in K + U$.
  Since $K$ is closed and $U$ is an arbitrary nbd of $0$, $x \in K$
  as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  A compact convex set $A$ need not be the convex hull of its extreme points.
  Take $E = \ell^\infty$, $e_n = \delta_n \in E$, $A$ the closed
  convex hull in $E$ of $e_n / n$ for $n \in \bN$.
  By (TODO: prop), the extreme points
  of $A$ are $0$ and the points $\{e_n / n\}$.
  $A$ is compact and contains all points $x = \sum_{n \geq 1} \lambda_n e_n / n$,
  $\lambda_n$ a convex combinations.

\begin{definition}
  For a Banach space $(X, \|\cdot\|_X)$, let $X'$ be the set of bounded
  linear functionals $L : X \to \bR$, i.e.
  $\sup_{x \in X} \lvert L(x) \rvert / \|x\| \leq c$ for some $c \geq 0$
  $\iff$ $L$ is linear and continuous.

  Given $L \in X'$, write $\|L\|_{X'}$ for smallest $c$
  that works $\|L\|_{X'} = \inf \{\lvert l(x) \rvert : \|x\| = 1\}$.

  FACT: $(X', \|\cdot\|_{X'})$ is a Banach space.
  Each $x \in X$ defines a linear map $X' \to \bR$ via evaluation
  \[
    e_x = L \mapsto L(x)
  \]
  The \emph{weak-$\ast$ topology} on $X'$ is the weakest/coarsest
  (i.e. initial topology) $\tau(X', \{e_x\}_{x \in X})$ that makes all of these 
  maps continuous.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Riesz representation theorem]
  Let $S$ be a compact Hausdorff space,
  $X = \cC(S)$ continuous functions from $S$ to $\bR$.
  $X$ is a Banach space with the $\sup$-norm $\|x\| = \sup_{s \in S} \lvert x(s) \rvert$.
  Then $X'$ finite signed memasures on $S$.
  associated with any finite signed measure $\mu$.
  is the continuous linear functional $L(x) = \int_S x(s) \mu(ds)$.

  We want to know what is $\|\cdot\|_{X'} = \|\cdot\|_{\mu(S)}$?
  If $L(x) = \int_S x(s) \mu(ds)$ then by definition
  \begin{align*}
    \|L\|_{X'} 
  &= \sup\{ \lvert L(x) \rvert : \|x\|_X = 1 \} \\
  &= \sup\left\{ \left\lvert \int_S x(s) \mu(ds) \right\rvert : \sup_{s \in S} \lvert x(s) \rvert = 1 \right\} \\
  &= \sup\left\{ \left\lvert \int_S x(s) \mu^+(ds)  - \int_S x(s) \mu^-(ds) \right\rvert : -1 \leq \lvert x(s) \rvert \leq 1 \right\}
\end{align*}
We know $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ are perpendicular; their supports are disjoint, so
\begin{align*}
  \|L\|_{X'} 
  &= \sup\left\{ \left\lvert 
      \int_{S^+} x(s) \mu^+(ds)  - \int_{S^-} x(s) \mu^-(ds)
  \right\rvert : -1 \leq \lvert x(s) \rvert \leq 1 \right\}
\end{align*}
Take $x = \ind_{S^+} - \ind_{S^-}$ to conclude
$\|L\|_{X'} = \mu^+(S^+) + \mu^-(S^-) = \mu^+(S) + \mu^-(S) = \lvert \mu \rvert(S) = \|\mu\|_{TV}$
Hence, $(\cC(S), \|\cdot\|_{\infty})$ has dual
$(M(S), \|\cdot\|_{TV})$ and the weak-$\ast$ topology on $M(S)$
is the weakest/coarsest/smallest topology that makes continuous
all maps $\mu \mapsto \int_S x(s) \mu(ds)$ for $x \in \cC(S)$.
Notice that this is strictly weaker than the TV topology, because for example
two unit point masses have TV norm 2 but
$\int x(s) \delta_{s'}(ds) = x(s') \approx x(s'') = \int x(s) \delta_{s''}(ds)$
when $s' \approx s''$.
\end{example}

This is the story for compact spaces. What about for only locally compact spaces?

Let $T$ Hausdorff LC, $M(T)$ real bounded signed Radon measures on $T$.
\begin{definition}
  $\cC_0(T)$ are the continuous functions vanishing at infinity, i.e.
  $f \in cC(T)$ such that $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(\pm x) = 0$.
\end{definition}

View $M(T)$ as the (Banach) dual of $C_0(T)$ equipped with weak-$\ast$
topology.
The set $M_+^1(T)$ of positive measures in $M(T)$ having total mass at most one
is compact and convex, because:

\begin{theorem}[Banach-Alaoglu]
  The unit ball in $(X', \|\cdot\|_{X'})$ is compact
  in the weak-$\ast$ topology.
\end{theorem}

We will show that the extreme points of $M_+^1(T)$ of are $0$ and the
Dirac measures $\delta_t$ for $t \in T$.

It is clear that $0$ is an extreme point of $M_+^1(T)$.

Suppose $\mu \neq 0$ is another element in $M_+^1((T)$, then it suffices
show $K = \supp \mu$ is a single point. If $t_1 \neq t_2 \in K$, then
by Hausdorffness choose $U_1 \ni t_1$ and $U_2 \ni t_2$ disjoint.
Then $m = \mu(U_1)$ satisfies $0 < m < 1$.

Define two measures $\alpha = (\mu \vert U_1) / m$ ($\mu$ restricted and renormalized)
and $\beta = (\mu - m \alpha) / (1 - m)$ what's left over after subtracting $m \alpha$.
Then $\alpha, \beta \in M_+^1(T)$, $\alpha \neq \beta$, and $\mu = m \alpha + (1 - m) \beta$,
contradicting $\mu$ extremal. Hence, $K$ is a single point.

A similar argument shows that if $T$ is compact, then the set of positive
measures of unit total mass is compact and convex, and that its extreme points
are the Dirac measures $\delta_t$.

\begin{theorem}[Stone-Weierstrass]
  Let $E$ be a subalgebra of $C(S)$. Suppose
  $E$ separates points and contains constants, then $E$ is dense in $C(S)$.
\end{theorem}
